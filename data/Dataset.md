# Dataset
We provide the datasets of [Pitts30k](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpF5nO1SivJ5QOx1kkhoCeMqFvvrksey/view?usp=sharing) and [St Lucia](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nEmjnEePTQNdB0JdKFE8ISJMcfbZMPPZ/view?usp=sharing])

About the datasets formatting, the adopted convention is that the names of the files with the images are:

@ UTM_easting @ UTM_northing @ UTM_zone_number @ UTM_zone_letter @ latitude @ longitude @ pano_id @ tile_num @ heading @ pitch @ roll @ height @ timestamp @ note @ extension

Note that some of these values can be empty (e.g. the timestamp might be unknown), and the only required values are UTM coordinates (obtained from latitude and longitude).
